This is a generic template for TypeScript projects. It uses npm as package manager.

It includes several scripts in `package.json`:
```sh
npm run build          # build for production
npm run start          # start production build, requires build first
npm run start:dev      # start in dev mode, without debugging
npm run start:debug    # start in dev mode, with debugging
npm run clean          # remove build files
```
