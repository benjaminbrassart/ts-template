This is a generic template for TypeScript projects. It uses yarn as package manager.

It includes several scripts in `package.json`:
```sh
yarn build          # build for production
yarn start          # start production build
yarn start:dev      # start in dev mode, without debugging
yarn start:debug    # start in dev mode, with debugging
yarn clean          # remove build files
```
